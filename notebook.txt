Initial Design note:
I wanna make users could choose their own madlibs between one and three
The code could automaticly choose the name inside the arrow brackets(dont think thats how you call it)
Make a loop instead of doing it multiple time
asked the player wanna play again or note

milestone chart(i did the milestone chart after i finished the madlib so there is no estimate time):
Rough draft : sep.26
Better users interactivity: sep.27
Get idea of how to do the loop & finish: sep.30
More madlib&better println statements(final draft): oct.1

Brief description & intended purpose:
This is a madlib programm let you do madlibs! There is five choices of madlibs with different amount of words. 
Its intended puprose is to create a more users interactivity madlib program
